A high-concept sci-fi, multiplayer, 3D first person dogfight game. 
Stylistic, colourful, with gorgeous varied terrain. Two or more players can ready-up into an exciting battle in the skies, filled with deadly bullets. Players can control the movement of their respective jets with the WASD keys and fire with SPACE. 

Fun fact: The name Fairy15 is inspired by the lead player object being an F15 jet and the scenery being dominated by a "fairy" castle.
